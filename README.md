# SavingBuckets üí∏

### SavingBuckets is a simple web application for managing and tracking savings goals.

# Introduction

SavingBuckets is a web application that helps users keep track of their savings goals and progress towards achieving them. With SavingBuckets, users can create multiple savings goals, set target amounts, and track their progress through a visual progress bar. The app also provides an overview of all savings goals and the option to edit or delete them.

SavingBuckets was created as a final year project for the software engineering certificate program at ALX Africa. The project was inspired by a personal need to better manage and track savings goals, and to create a simple platform for myself and others to use.

# Inspiration
The seed for this project was planted while I was playing Townships, a game that gave me immense joy from completing tasks and sending out orders.

A few months later, I found myself with several savings goals in mind but often forgetting what I was saving for once I had enough money in my account. This led me to the realization that I needed a system that would consider my available funds and desired purchases.

Townships provided me with the inspiration for such a satisfying system. And thus, the idea for SavingBuckets was born.

My goal was to create a system that would notify me when I had enough funds to make a purchase. Additionally, I wanted a simplified list of my savings goals so that I could track my progress and feel the satisfaction of achieving each one.

# Usage
Once the site is up and running, you can create new savings accounts and savings goals. Fill in the details of your new savings account and savings goal, and click "Save". You will then be redirected to the overview page where you can see a list of all your savings accounts and saving goals, including the new ones you created.

To update or delete a goal, simply click on the "Edit" or "Delete" buttons next to the goal. You can also track your progress towards each goal using the visual progress bar.

# What is next? ‚ö°Ô∏è
As I continue to develop SavingBuckets, I'm constantly looking for ways to improve the user experience and make the site more engaging. Here are some of the improvements I am working on:

- Enhancing the design: I want to make the site look more professional by adding in more graphics,photos, icons, etc. I believe this will not only make the site more visually appealing but also make it easier for users to navigate and engage with.

- Improving styling: I'm working on improving the styling of the site to make it more visually consistent and appealing across all devices. Because of time restraints, the site does not work perfectly on mobile, yet.

- Adding new features: I am always looking to add new features that make SavingBuckets more useful for our users. Some of the ideas I want to exploring a mobile app version of the site.

Stay tuned for more updates and improvements!

# Challenges Faced ü•¥

As someone who primarily focuses on backend development, I was caught off guard by how time-consuming the frontend development process was. From ensuring proper alignment to selecting the right color and size for each element, I found myself spending more time on frontend development than I initially anticipated. However, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed building the frontend. Constantly striving for improvement and making things better was like a game to me. Although it did take me longer than expected, the experience has inspired me to explore design and frontend projects in more depth.
