# SavingBuckets

SavingBuckets is a simple web application for managing and tracking savings goals.

## Introduction

SavingBuckets is a web application that helps users keep track of their savings goals and progress towards achieving them. With SavingBuckets, users can create multiple savings goals, set target amounts, and track their progress through a visual progress bar. The app also provides an overview of all savings goals and the option to edit or delete them.

SavingBuckets was created as a final year project for the software engineering certificate program at ALX Africa. The project was inspired by a personal need to better manage and track savings goals, and to create a simple platform for myself and others to use.
